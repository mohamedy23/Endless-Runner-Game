# Endless-Runner-Game 
In this project, I created a simple infinite runner game which is similar to Subway
Surfers. The player controls a sphere that moves forward automatically on an infinite floor. The
floor is divided into three lanes. The player needs to dodge obstacles while managing
both ability and health points in order to avoid dying. The player encounters Collectibles: that can be found along the road and collecting them increases the player’s
resources; and Obstacles: that can be found along the road and touching them decreases
the player’s health points. The player’s goal
is to achieve the highest score possible before losing all their health points.
